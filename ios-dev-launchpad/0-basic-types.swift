/** Int */

/** TYPES FOUNDATIONS */
/** Type Safe
 Swift is a safety language because you cannot mix types, if you declare a variable as Int, it is not possible re assign a value with a different type */
var a: Double = 34
// a = "PitÃ¡goras" -> Cannot assign value of type 'String' to type 'Int'

/** Type Inference
 This is a great feature of Swift because is not necessary difine the type of our variables when we create them */
var b = 18 // Swift compiler creates it as Int

/** Type Annotations
 Finally if you can be explicity about the type you save in your variables, you can add type annotations */
var hypotenuse: Int = 0

/** Remember, you cannot mix types */
// hypotenuse = (a * a + b * b).squareRoot() -> Cannot convert value of type 'Int' to expected argument type 'Double'
